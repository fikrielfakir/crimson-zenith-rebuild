🎨 Phase 9: UI/UX Enhancements ( 7)
Step 9.1: Loading States & Skeletons
For every data-fetching component, add:

Skeleton loaders using shadcn/ui Skeleton
Loading spinners for actions
Progressive loading (show data as it arrives)
Error states with retry buttons


Step 9.2: Empty States
For all lists/tables, add empty states when no data:

Friendly illustration or icon
Helpful message
Call-to-action button (e.g., "Add your first club")
Use shadcn/ui Card for empty state containers


Step 9.3: Toast Notifications
Implement toast notifications for all actions:

Success toasts (green)
Error toasts (red)
Info toasts (blue)
Warning toasts (yellow)
Use shadcn/ui Sonner or Toast
Position: bottom-right
Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
Action buttons in toasts (e.g., "Undo")

Step 9.4: Responsive Design Optimization
Ensure all admin pages are mobile-responsive:
Mobile Navigation:

Sidebar becomes bottom sheet/drawer
Hamburger menu in header
Fixed bottom navigation for key actions
Swipe gestures for drawer

Table Responsiveness:

Convert tables to card layout on mobile
Stack columns vertically
Show most important columns only
"View more" expandable sections
Horizontal scroll for wide tables with sticky first column

Form Optimization:

Full-width inputs on mobile
Larger touch targets (min 44px)
Sticky form submission buttons
Progressive disclosure (show fields as needed)

Mobile-specific Features:

Pull-to-refresh
Infinite scroll for lists
Bottom sheets for modals
Native-like transitions


Step 9.5: Dark Mode Support
Implement comprehensive dark mode:

Use CSS variables for all colors
Toggle in AdminLayout header
Store preference in localStorage
Respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme)
Smooth transition between modes

Dark mode color scheme:
css:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background: #0a0a0a;
  --foreground: #ededed;
  --card: #1a1a1a;
  --card-foreground: #ededed;
  --primary: #3b82f6;
  --primary-foreground: #ffffff;
  /* etc. */
}
Test dark mode on:

All admin pages
All modals/dialogs
Charts and graphs
Data tables
Forms
Loading states


Step 9.6: Keyboard Shortcuts
Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users:

Cmd/Ctrl + K - Open command palette
Cmd/Ctrl + / - Show keyboard shortcuts help
Cmd/Ctrl + S - Save current form
Cmd/Ctrl + N - New item (context-dependent)
Cmd/Ctrl + E - Edit selected item
Esc - Close modal/dialog
Arrow keys - Navigate tables/lists
Enter - Confirm action
Del/Backspace - Delete selected item

Create: src/components/admin/KeyboardShortcuts.tsx

Modal showing all available shortcuts
Grouped by category (Navigation, Actions, etc.)
Visual keyboard key display
Search shortcuts
Triggered by Cmd + /


Step 9.7: Accessibility Improvements
WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:

Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
ARIA labels on all interactive elements
Focus indicators (visible focus states)
Keyboard navigation for all features
Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
Color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1)
Alt text for all images
Form labels properly associated
Error messages clearly announced

Test with:

Screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
Keyboard-only navigation
High contrast mode
Zoom to 200%


🔐 Phase 10: Security & Validation ( 8)
Step 10.1: Form Validation
Implement comprehensive validation for all forms:
Client-side validation:

Use React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
Real-time validation on blur
Show inline error messages
Disable submit until valid
Custom validators for:

Email format
Phone format
URL format
Password strength
File size/type
Date ranges



Example validation schema:
typescriptimport { z } from 'zod';

const clubSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3, 'Name must be at least 3 characters'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^[0-9+\-\s()]+$/, 'Invalid phone number'),
  description: z.string().min(20, 'Description too short'),
  location: z.string().min(1, 'Location required'),
  website: z.string().url('Invalid URL').optional(),
  memberCount: z.number().int().positive().optional(),
});
Server-side validation:

Validate all API requests
Return detailed error messages
Sanitize inputs (prevent XSS)
Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints


Step 10.2: Permission System
Create: src/hooks/usePermissions.ts
Role-based access control:
typescriptconst permissions = {
  admin: ['*'], // all permissions
  moderator: [
    'users.view', 'users.edit',
    'clubs.view', 'clubs.edit', 'clubs.approve',
    'events.view', 'events.edit',
    'content.view', 'content.edit',
  ],
  content_manager: [
    'content.view', 'content.edit', 'content.create',
    'media.view', 'media.upload',
  ],
};

const usePermissions = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  const hasPermission = (permission: string) => {
    const userPermissions = permissions[user.role] || [];
    return userPermissions.includes('*') || userPermissions.includes(permission);
  };
  
  return { hasPermission };
};
Implement permission checks:

Wrap actions in permission checks
Hide UI elements user doesn't have access to
Show permission denied messages
Redirect unauthorized access attempts

Example usage:
typescriptconst { hasPermission } = usePermissions();

{hasPermission('users.delete') && (
  <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete User</Button>
)}

Step 10.3: Audit Logging
Enhance Activity Log with detailed audit trails:
Log all admin actions:

Who performed the action
What action was performed
When it was performed
What entity was affected
Before/after values for updates
IP address and user agent
Session ID

Create: src/utils/auditLog.ts
typescriptexport const logAction = async (action: {
  userId: string;
  action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  entityType: string;
  entityId: string;
  changes?: Record<string, any>;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}) => {
  await fetch('/api/audit-log', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ...action,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      ipAddress: getUserIP(),
      userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
    }),
  });
};
Integrate audit logging into all mutations:
typescriptconst deleteUserMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: deleteUser,
  onSuccess: (data, userId) => {
    logAction({
      userId: currentUser.id,
      action: 'delete',
      entityType: 'user',
      entityId: userId,
    });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries('users');
  },
});

Step 10.4: Data Sanitization
Prevent XSS and injection attacks:
Install and use DOMPurify:
bashnpm install dompurify @types/dompurify
Create: src/utils/sanitize.ts
typescriptimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

export const sanitizeHTML = (html: string) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(html, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'br', 'strong', 'em', 'u', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'a'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href', 'target', 'rel'],
  });
};

export const sanitizeInput = (input: string) => {
  return input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '');
};
Use in all rich text displays:
typescript<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ 
  __html: sanitizeHTML(content) 
}} />

Step 10.5: CSRF Protection
Implement CSRF tokens:

Use csurf middleware on backend
Include CSRF token in all mutation requests
Validate token on server
Refresh token on expiration

Create: src/hooks/useCSRFToken.ts
typescriptconst useCSRFToken = () => {
  const { data: token } = useQuery('csrfToken', fetchCSRFToken);
  return token;
};
Include in all POST/PUT/DELETE requests:
typescriptconst mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (data) => {
    const csrfToken = useCSRFToken();
    return fetch('/api/endpoint', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
  },
});

📊 Phase 11: Advanced Features ( 8-9)
Step 11.1: Batch Processing
For large datasets, implement batch processing:
Create: src/components/admin/BatchProcessor.tsx
Features:

Process records in batches (e.g., 100 at a time)
Progress bar showing completion
Pause/resume capability
Error handling (continue on error or stop)
Results summary (success/failed counts)
Export failed records

Use cases:

Bulk user import from CSV
Bulk email sending
Bulk image optimization
Bulk data migration

Example implementation:
typescriptconst BatchProcessor = ({ records, processFn, onComplete }) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);
  const [results, setResults] = useState({ success: 0, failed: 0 });
  
  const processBatch = async (batch) => {
    for (const record of batch) {
      if (isPaused) break;
      try {
        await processFn(record);
        setResults(r => ({ ...r, success: r.success + 1 }));
      } catch (error) {
        setResults(r => ({ ...r, failed: r.failed + 1 }));
      }
      setProgress(p => p + 1);
    }
  };
  
  // Process in batches of 100
  const batchSize = 100;
  for (let i = 0; i < records.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = records.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    await processBatch(batch);
  }
  
  onComplete(results);
};

Step 11.2: Data Caching Strategy
Implement intelligent caching with React Query:
Create: src/lib/queryClient.ts
typescriptimport { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
});
Cache strategies by data type:

Static data (long cache):

Theme settings: 1 hour
System config: 1 hour
Categories: 30 minutes


Semi-dynamic data (medium cache):

User list: 5 minutes
Club list: 5 minutes
Stats: 2 minutes


Dynamic data (short cache):

Event participants: 30 seconds
Booking status: 30 seconds
Notifications: 15 seconds



Prefetching:
typescript// Prefetch likely next page
const prefetchNextPage = (currentPage) => {
  queryClient.prefetchQuery(['users', currentPage + 1], () =>
    fetchUsers(currentPage + 1)
  );
};
Optimistic updates:
typescriptconst updateUserMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: updateUser,
  onMutate: async (newData) => {
    // Cancel outgoing refetches
    await queryClient.cancelQueries(['user', newData.id]);
    
    // Snapshot previous value
    const previous = queryClient.getQueryData(['user', newData.id]);
    
    // Optimistically update
    queryClient.setQueryData(['user', newData.id], newData);
    
    return { previous };
  },
  onError: (err, newData, context) => {
    // Rollback on error
    queryClient.setQueryData(['user', newData.id], context.previous);
  },
  onSettled: (data, error, variables) => {
    // Refetch to ensure sync
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['user', variables.id]);
  },
});

Step 11.3: Real-time Updates with WebSockets
Implement Socket.io for real-time features:
Create: src/hooks/useSocket.ts
typescriptimport { useEffect } from 'react';
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const useSocket = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = io(import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL);
    
    // Listen for real-time updates
    socket.on('user:created', (user) => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['users']);
      toast.success('New user registered!');
    });
    
    socket.on('booking:created', (booking) => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['bookings']);
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['stats']);
      toast.info('New booking received!');
    });
    
    socket.on('club:approved', (club) => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['clubs']);
      toast.success(`Club "${club.name}" approved!`);
    });
    
    return () => socket.disconnect();
  }, [queryClient]);
};
Use in AdminLayout:
typescriptconst AdminLayout = ({ children }) => {
  useSocket(); // Enable real-time updates
  
  return (
    <div className="admin-layout">
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
Real-time features:

Live notification updates
Live booking updates
Live user count updates
Live event participant updates
Admin collaboration (show who's editing what)


Step 11.4: Advanced Filtering & Search
Create: src/components/admin/AdvancedFilters.tsx
Reusable advanced filtering component:
Features:

Multiple filter criteria
Filter combinations (AND/OR logic)
Saved filter presets
Filter tags display
Clear all filters
Export filtered results

Filter types:

Text search (contains, starts with, ends with, exact)
Number range (min, max)
Date range (from, to, last 7/30/90 days)
Select (single, multiple)
Boolean (yes/no/any)
Custom filters

Example usage:
typescript<AdvancedFilters
  fields={[
    { name: 'name', label: 'Name', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'status', label: 'Status', type: 'select', options: ['active', 'inactive'] },
    { name: 'createdAt', label: 'Created', type: 'dateRange' },
    { name: 'memberCount', label: 'Members', type: 'numberRange' },
  ]}
  onFilterChange={(filters) => {
    setFilters(filters);
  }}
  savedPresets={[
    { name: 'Active Clubs', filters: { status: 'active' } },
    { name: 'New This Week', filters: { createdAt: { last: '7days' } } },
  ]}
/>
Implement search highlighting:

Highlight search terms in results
Use <mark> tag for highlights
Case-insensitive matching


Step 11.5: Data Visualization Dashboard
Enhance dashboard with interactive charts:
Create custom chart components:
1. Users Growth Chart:
typescript<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <LineChart data={userGrowthData}>
    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
    <XAxis dataKey="month" />
    <YAxis />
    <Tooltip />
    <Legend />
    <Line 
      type="monotone" 
      dataKey="users" 
      stroke="#3b82f6" 
      strokeWidth={2}
      dot={{ fill: '#3b82f6', r: 4 }}
    />
  </LineChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
2. Revenue by Category (Pie Chart):
typescript<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <PieChart>
    <Pie
      data={revenueData}
      dataKey="value"
      nameKey="name"
      cx="50%"
      cy="50%"
      outerRadius={80}
      label
    >
      {revenueData.map((entry, index) => (
        <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={COLORS[index % COLORS.length]} />
      ))}
    </Pie>
    <Tooltip />
    <Legend />
  </PieChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
3. Event Attendance Heatmap:
typescript<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
  <BarChart data={attendanceData}>
    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
    <XAxis dataKey="event" />
    <YAxis />
    <Tooltip />
    <Legend />
    <Bar dataKey="registered" fill="#3b82f6" />
    <Bar dataKey="attended" fill="#10b981" />
  </BarChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
Interactive features:

Click chart to drill down
Hover for detailed tooltips
Export chart as image
Toggle data series visibility
Zoom and pan
Time period selector


Step 11.6: Export & Reporting System
Create: src/components/admin/ReportGenerator.tsx
Automated report generation:

  const [reportType, setReportType] = useState('users');
  const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState({ from: null, to: null });
  const [format, setFormat] = useState('pdf');
  
  const generateReport = async () => {
    const report = await fetch('/api/reports/generate', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ reportType, dateRange, format }),
    });
    
    const blob = await report.blob();
    downloadFile(blob, `report-${reportType}-${Date.now()}.${format}`);
  };
  
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Generate Report</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Select value={reportType} onValueChange={setReportType}>
          <SelectTrigger>
            <SelectValue />
          </SelectTrigger>
          <SelectContent>
            <SelectItem value="users">User Report</SelectItem>

            <SelectItem value="csv">CSV</SelectItem>
          </SelectContent>
        </Select>
        
        <Button onClick={generateReport}>
          <Download className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
          Generate Report
        </Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};

🧪 Phase 12: Testing & Quality Assurance ( 9-10)
Step 12.1: Component Testing
Set up testing environment:
bashnpm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event vitest jsdom
Create test files for each component:
Example: src/pages/admin/__tests__/UserManagement.test.tsx
typescriptimport { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { UserManagement } from '../UserManagement';

describe('UserManagement', () => {
  it('renders user table', async () => {
    render(
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <UserManagement />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    );
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByRole('table')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
  
  it('filters users by search term', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<UserManagement />);
    
    const searchInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Search users...');
    await user.type(searchInput, 'John');
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.queryByText('Jane Smith')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
  
  it('opens edit dialog when edit button clicked', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<UserManagement />);
    
    const editButton = screen.getAllByRole('button', { name: /edit/i })[0];
    await user.click(editButton);
    
    expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
Test coverage goals:

Unit tests for utilities and hooks: 80%+
Component tests for critical flows: 60%+
Integration tests for key features: 50%+


Step 12.2: E2E Testing
Set up Playwright or Cypress:
bashnpm install -D @playwright/test
Create E2E test suites:
Example: e2e/admin-login.spec.ts
typescriptimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('admin login flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/admin/login');
  
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'admin@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/admin');
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Dashboard');
});

test('create new club', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login first
  await page.goto('/admin/login');
  // ... login steps
  
  await page.goto('/admin/clubs');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Add New Club")');
  
  await page.fill('input[name="name"]', 'Test Club');
  await page.fill('textarea[name="description"]', 'Test description');
  await page.fill('input[name="location"]', 'Casablanca');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Save")');
  
  await expect(page.locator('.toast')).toContainText('Club created');
  await expect(page.locator('table')).toContainText('Test Club');
});
Critical E2E flows to test:

Admin login/logout
User CRUD operations
Club CRUD operations
Event creation and management
Booking workflow
Media upload
Settings changes
Report generation


Step 12.3: Performance Testing
Use Lighthouse for performance audits:
Run Lighthouse on admin pages:
bashlighthouse https://your-admin-url.com/admin --view
Performance targets:

First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
Total Blocking Time: < 300ms

Optimization strategies:

Code splitting (lazy load routes)
Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
Bundle size reduction (tree shaking)
Memoization of expensive calculations
Virtual scrolling for large lists
Debouncing search inputs
Pagination for large datasets

Example code splitting:
typescriptconst UserManagement = lazy(() => import('./pages/admin/UserManagement'));
const ClubsManagement = lazy(() => import('./pages/admin/ClubsManagement'));

<Route
  path="/admin/users"
  element={
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <UserManagement />
    </Suspense>
  }
/>

Step 12.4: Accessibility Audit
Use tools:

axe DevTools browser extension
WAVE browser extension
Lighthouse accessibility audit

Manual testing:

Keyboard-only navigation
Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
High contrast mode
Text scaling to 200%
Color blindness simulation

Common issues to fix:

Missing alt text
Low color contrast
Missing form labels
Broken keyboard navigation
Missing ARIA landmarks
Improper heading hierarchy


Step 12.5: Browser Compatibility Testing
Test on:

Chrome (latest, latest - 1)
Firefox (latest, latest - 1)
Safari (latest, latest - 1)

🚀 Phase 14: Deployment & Optimization ( 10-11)
Step 14.1: Build Optimization
Optimize production build:
vite.config.ts optimization:
typescriptexport default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          'vendor-react': ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
          'vendor-ui': ['@radix-ui/react-dialog', '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu', ...],
          'vendor-charts': ['recharts'],
          'vendor-forms': ['react-hook-form', 'zod'],
        },
      },
    },
    chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['react', 'react-dom'],
  },
});
Image optimization:

Convert to WebP
Generate multiple sizes
Implement lazy loading
Use CDN for static assets

Font optimization:

Subset fonts (Latin only if applicable)
Use font-display: swap
Preload critical fonts


Step 14.2: Caching Strategy
HTTP caching headers:
nginx# Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js|woff2)$ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}

# HTML (admin pages)
location ~* \.html$ {
  expires -1;
  add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate";
}
Service Worker for offline support:
typescript// service-worker.ts
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('admin-v1').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/admin',
        '/admin/users',
        '/admin/clubs',
        // ... critical admin routes
      ]);
    })
  );
});

Step 14.3: Error Tracking
Integrate Sentry or similar:
bashnpm install @sentry/react
Configure error tracking:
typescriptimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

typescriptimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: import.meta.env.MODE,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV6Instrumentation(
        useEffect,
        useLocation,
        useNavigationType,
        createRoutesFromChildren,
        matchRoutes
      ),
    }),
    new Sentry.Replay({
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
Add error boundaries:
typescript// src/components/admin/ErrorBoundary.tsx
import { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean;
  error?: Error;
}

class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    Sentry.captureException(error, {
      contexts: {
        react: {
          componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,
        },
      },
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return this.props.fallback || (
        <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center p-4">
          <Card className="max-w-md">
            <CardHeader>
              <CardTitle>Something went wrong</CardTitle>
              <CardDescription>
                An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified.
              </CardDescription>
            </CardHeader>
            <CardContent>
              <Button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>
                Reload Page
              </Button>
            </CardContent>
          </Card>
        </div>
      );
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
Wrap admin routes:
typescript<Route
  path="/admin/*"
  element={
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <ProtectedRoute>
        {/* Admin routes */}
      </ProtectedRoute>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  }
/>

Step 14.4: Analytics Integration
Add admin analytics tracking:
typescript// src/utils/analytics.ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

export const usePageTracking = () => {
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Google Analytics
    if (window.gtag) {
      window.gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
        page_path: location.pathname,
      });
    }

    // Custom analytics
    fetch('/api/analytics/pageview', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        path: location.pathname,
        timestamp: new Date(),
      }),
    });
  }, [location]);
};

export const trackEvent = (eventName: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => {
  // Google Analytics
  if (window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', eventName, properties);
  }

  // Custom analytics
  fetch('/api/analytics/event', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      event: eventName,
      properties,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    }),
  });
};
Track important admin actions:
typescript// In UserManagement.tsx
const deleteUser = () => {
  trackEvent('admin_delete_user', { userId: user.id });
  // ... deletion logic
};

const approveClub = () => {
  trackEvent('admin_approve_club', { clubId: club.id });
  // ... approval logic
};
Create admin analytics dashboard showing:

Most used admin features
Average time spent on pages
Action frequency (CRUD operations)
Error rates by page
Admin user activity


Step 14.5: Performance Monitoring
Add performance tracking:
typescript// src/utils/performance.ts
export const measurePerformance = (metricName: string, startTime: number) => {
  const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
  
  // Send to analytics
  trackEvent('performance_metric', {
    metric: metricName,
    duration: Math.round(duration),
  });
  
  // Log slow operations
  if (duration > 1000) {
    console.warn(`Slow operation: ${metricName} took ${duration}ms`);
  }
};

// Usage
const startTime = performance.now();
await fetchUsers();
measurePerformance('fetch_users', startTime);
Monitor:

API response times
Component render times
Query execution times
Image load times
Bundle load times

Set up alerts for:

Response time > 3 seconds
Error rate > 5%
Memory usage > 80%
CPU usage > 80%


🎓 Phase 15: Advanced Admin Features ( 11-12)
Step 15.1: Multi-language Admin Support
Add i18n to admin interface:
bashnpm install i18next react-i18next
Configure i18n:
typescript// src/i18n/admin.ts
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';

const resources = {
  en: {
    admin: {
      dashboard: {
        title: 'Dashboard',
        totalUsers: 'Total Users',
        activeClubs: 'Active Clubs',
        // ... more translations
      },
      users: {
        title: 'User Management',
        addUser: 'Add User',
        editUser: 'Edit User',
        deleteUser: 'Delete User',
        // ... more translations
      },
      // ... more namespaces
    },
  },
  fr: {
    admin: {
      dashboard: {
        title: 'Tableau de bord',
        totalUsers: 'Total des utilisateurs',
        activeClubs: 'Clubs actifs',
        // ... French translations
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
  ar: {
    admin: {
      dashboard: {
        title: 'لوحة القيادة',
        totalUsers: 'إجمالي المستخدمين',
        activeClubs: 'الأندية النشطة',
        // ... Arabic translations
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
};

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  resources,
  lng: 'en',
  fallbackLng: 'en',
  interpolation: {
    escapeValue: false,
  },
});

export default i18n;
Use in components:
typescriptimport { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const UserManagement = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('admin');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('users.title')}</h1>
      <Button>{t('users.addUser')}</Button>
    </div>
  );
};
Language switcher in header:
typescriptconst LanguageSwitcher = () => {
  const { i18n } = useTranslation();

  return (
    <Select value={i18n.language} onValueChange={(lng) => i18n.changeLanguage(lng)}>
      <SelectTrigger className="w-24">
        <SelectValue />
      </SelectTrigger>
      <SelectContent>
        <SelectItem value="en">EN</SelectItem>
        <SelectItem value="fr">FR</SelectItem>
        <SelectItem value="ar">AR</SelectItem>
      </SelectContent>
    </Select>
  );
};

Step 15.2: Advanced Role Management
Create: src/pages/admin/RoleManagement.tsx
Granular permission system:
Roles table:

Role name (Admin, Moderator, Content Manager, Event Manager, etc.)
Description
User count
Permissions (expandable list)
Actions (Edit, Delete, Duplicate)

Create/Edit Role Dialog:
typescriptconst RoleDialog = ({ role, onSave }) => {
  const [permissions, setPermissions] = useState(role?.permissions || []);

  const permissionGroups = {
    users: [
      { key: 'users.view', label: 'View Users' },
      { key: 'users.create', label: 'Create Users' },
      { key: 'users.edit', label: 'Edit Users' },
      { key: 'users.delete', label: 'Delete Users' },
      { key: 'users.manage_roles', label: 'Manage User Roles' },
    ],
    clubs: [
      { key: 'clubs.view', label: 'View Clubs' },
      { key: 'clubs.create', label: 'Create Clubs' },
      { key: 'clubs.edit', label: 'Edit Clubs' },
      { key: 'clubs.delete', label: 'Delete Clubs' },
      { key: 'clubs.approve', label: 'Approve Clubs' },
    ],
    events: [
      { key: 'events.view', label: 'View Events' },
      { key: 'events.create', label: 'Create Events' },
      { key: 'events.edit', label: 'Edit Events' },
      { key: 'events.delete', label: 'Delete Events' },
      { key: 'events.manage_participants', label: 'Manage Participants' },
    ],
    content: [
      { key: 'content.view', label: 'View Content' },
      { key: 'content.create', label: 'Create Content' },
      { key: 'content.edit', label: 'Edit Content' },
      { key: 'content.delete', label: 'Delete Content' },
      { key: 'content.publish', label: 'Publish Content' },
    ],
    settings: [
      { key: 'settings.view', label: 'View Settings' },
      { key: 'settings.edit', label: 'Edit Settings' },
      { key: 'settings.manage_theme', label: 'Manage Theme' },
      { key: 'settings.manage_payments', label: 'Manage Payments' },
    ],
    analytics: [
      { key: 'analytics.view', label: 'View Analytics' },
      { key: 'analytics.export', label: 'Export Data' },
    ],
    system: [
      { key: 'system.view', label: 'View System Info' },
      { key: 'system.manage', label: 'Manage System' },
      { key: 'system.view_logs', label: 'View Logs' },
    ],
  };

  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogContent className="max-w-2xl max-h-[80vh] overflow-y-auto">
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>{role ? 'Edit Role' : 'Create Role'}</DialogTitle>
        </DialogHeader>
        
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <Label>Role Name</Label>
            <Input placeholder="e.g., Content Manager" />
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <Label>Description</Label>
            <Textarea placeholder="Describe this role..." />
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <Label>Permissions</Label>
            <Accordion type="multiple">
              {Object.entries(permissionGroups).map(([group, perms]) => (
                <AccordionItem key={group} value={group}>
                  <AccordionTrigger className="capitalize">
                    {group}

                        <div key={perm.key} className="flex items-center space-x-2">
                          <Checkbox
                            checked={permissions.includes(perm.key)}
                            onCheckedChange={(checked) => {
                              if (checked) {
                                setPermissions([...permissions, perm.key]);
                              } else {
                                setPermissions(permissions.filter(p => p !== perm.key));
                              }
                            }}
                          />
                          <Label>{perm.label}</Label>
                        </div>
                      ))}

            Save Role
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
Assign roles to users:

In user edit dialog, add role selector
Support multiple roles per user
Show inherited permissions


Step 15.3: Activity Timeline
Create: src/components/admin/ActivityTimeline.tsx
Visual timeline of all admin actions:
typescriptconst ActivityTimeline = () => {
  const { data: activities } = useQuery('activities', fetchActivities);

  const getActivityIcon = (type: string) => {
    const icons = {
      user_created: UserPlus,
      user_updated: UserCog,
      user_deleted: UserX,
      club_approved: CheckCircle,
      club_rejected: XCircle,
      event_created: Calendar,
      content_published: FileText,
      settings_changed: Settings,
    };
    return icons[type] || Activity;
  };

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Recent Activity</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <ScrollArea className="h-96">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            {activities.map((activity) => {
              const Icon = getActivityIcon(activity.type);
              return (
                <div key={activity.id} className="flex gap-4">
                  <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                    <div className="rounded-full bg-primary/10 p-2">
                      <Icon className="h-4 w-4 text-primary" />
                    </div>
                    {/* Vertical line */}
                    <div className="h-full w-px bg-border" />
                  </div>
                  
                  <div className="flex-1 pb-4">
                    <div className="flex items-start justify-between">
                      <div>

                        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                          {activity.description}
                        </p>
                        <div className="mt-1 flex items-center gap-2 text-xs text-muted-foreground">
                          <Avatar className="h-4 w-4">
                            <AvatarImage src={activity.user.avatar} />
                            <AvatarFallback>{activity.user.initials}</AvatarFallback>
                          </Avatar>
                          <span>{activity.user.name}</span>
                          <span>•</span>
                          <span>{formatRelativeTime(activity.timestamp)}</span>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      
                      {activity.entityLink && (
                        <Button variant="ghost" size="sm" asChild>
                          <Link to={activity.entityLink}>View</Link>
                        </Button>
                      )}
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            })}
          </div>
        </ScrollArea>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
};
Add to dashboard and dedicated page /admin/activity

Step 15.4: Webhook Management
Create: src/pages/admin/WebhookManagement.tsx
Allow admins to configure webhooks for external integrations:
Webhooks table:

Name
URL
Events (which events trigger webhook)
Status (active/inactive)
Last triggered
Success rate
Actions

Create Webhook Dialog:
typescriptconst WebhookDialog = () => {
  const events = [
    'user.created',
    'user.updated',
    'user.deleted',
    'club.approved',
    'club.rejected',
    'event.created',
    'event.updated',
    'booking.created',
    'booking.cancelled',
    'payment.successful',
    'payment.failed',
  ];

  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Add Webhook</DialogTitle>
        </DialogHeader>
        
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <Label>Name</Label>
            <Input placeholder="My Webhook" />
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <Label>Webhook URL</Label>
            <Input type="url" placeholder="https://api.example.com/webhook" />
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <Label>Events</Label>
            <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-2">
              {events.map((event) => (
                <div key={event} className="flex items-center space-x-2">
                  <Checkbox id={event} />
                  <Label htmlFor={event} className="text-sm">
                    {event}
                  </Label>
                </div>
              ))}
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <Label>Secret Key (optional)</Label>
            <Input type="password" placeholder="For signature verification" />
          </div>
