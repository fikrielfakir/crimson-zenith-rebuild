Logic & Design Description — “Our Clubs” Section
🧭 1. Layout Recap

Full-screen section with:

Left side: list of cities

Center/top: title + subtitle

Map background (Google Maps or image)

Bottom center: club cards

Right side: zoom & settings buttons

🧩 2. Club Card Behavior (Core Logic)

Each club card represents a single location.

Default State:

All cards are visible at the bottom in a horizontal row.

The first club (or the first city’s default club) is selected automatically on load.

The map pin appears at that club’s coordinates.

The selected card has a highlighted state (slightly scaled, glowing border, and visible “Get More” button).

When a Card is Clicked:

Change Selected Card:

Update selectedClubId (or activeClub) in state.

Visually highlight the clicked card:

Slight scale-up: transform: scale(1.05)

Add glowing border: box-shadow: 0px 4px 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)

Change background gradient to a brighter shade.

Show “Get More” button if hidden.

Update Map View:

Center the map on the clicked club’s latitude and longitude.

Drop a map pin marker with animation (bounce or drop).

Previous marker disappears or becomes dimmed.

Optional smooth transition:

Animate map panning with an ease-out curve over 1.5s.

If using Google Maps, use:

map.panTo({ lat: club.lat, lng: club.lng });


Update Info Box (optional):

A small tooltip or info box near the pin can show:

Clubs 02 ENSAH
62 Via A, Bokidadan AL Hoceima


Include a “Get More” button linking to a detail page.

⚙️ 3. City Selection Logic
Left-side City List:

When a user clicks a city name:

Update selectedCity

Filter visible cards to only clubs in that city

Automatically select the first club of that city

Move the map view to that city’s coordinates (zoom out slightly first, then zoom in)

Update active map pin

Example logic:
const [selectedCity, setSelectedCity] = useState("Al Hoceima");
const [selectedClub, setSelectedClub] = useState(clubsData[0]);


When city changes:

const clubsInCity = clubsData.filter(c => c.city === selectedCity);
setSelectedClub(clubsInCity[0]);
map.panTo({ lat: clubsInCity[0].lat, lng: clubsInCity[0].lng });

🗺️ 4. Map Pin Behavior

Each club has its own pin coordinate:

{
  "id": "club-01",
  "name": "Clubs 01 FSTH",
  "city": "Al Hoceima",
  "lat": 35.2501,
  "lng": -3.9402
}

Pin Styles:

Default (inactive): small circle or logo icon with opacity 0.5

Active (selected club):

Scale 1.5x

Bright yellow or gold pin color

Add pulse animation:

@keyframes pulse {
  0% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.2); opacity: 0.7; }
  100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}


Apply on active pin only.

🖱️ 5. Hover Interactions

Hover over a card → temporary highlight + show small pin preview on the map.

Click confirms selection (activates card + moves map).

Hover off returns to previous selection state unless clicked.

🧱 6. Data Structure Example
const clubsData = [
  {
    id: "club01",
    name: "Clubs 01 FSTH",
    city: "Al Hoceima",
    address: "62 Via A, Bokidadan AL Hoceima",
    lat: 35.2501,
    lng: -3.9402,
    image: "fsth.jpg"
  },
  {
    id: "club02",
    name: "Clubs 02 ENSAH",
    city: "Al Hoceima",
    address: "62 Via A, Bokidadan AL Hoceima",
    lat: 35.2515,
    lng: -3.9387,
    image: "ensah.jpg"
  }
];

🔄 7. Animation & Transitions

Smooth transitions for card selection and map pin updates:

Card hover: transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out

Card click: scale(1.05) with shadow and gradient shift

Map marker: bounce or fade-in animation

Map panning: smooth easing (easeOutQuad)

📲 8. Mobile Responsiveness

On mobile, city list collapses into a dropdown at the top.

Club cards become horizontally scrollable carousel.

Map controls move to bottom-right corner.

Summary

Clicking a club card updates the active selection visually and dynamically focuses the map on that club’s coordinates.
The selected card expands, changes gradient, and displays its full info with a “Get More” button.
The map shows a pulsating pin at the selected location, replacing the previous marker.
Selecting another city filters clubs and repositions the map accordingly.
