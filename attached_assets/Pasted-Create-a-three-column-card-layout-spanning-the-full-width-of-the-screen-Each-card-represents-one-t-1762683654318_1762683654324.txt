Create a three-column card layout spanning the full width of the screen.

Each card represents one theme: Tourism, Culture, and Entertainment.

Each card has a full-height background image, covering the entire card area with object-fit: cover.

Add a vertical white divider line (2–3px) between the three cards.

Top Gradient Overlay

Apply a linear gradient overlay from top to bottom:

Gradient direction: 180deg (top → bottom)

Colors: start with deep navy blue #0A1A3D at the top → fade to transparent at 60%.

Opacity: 70–80% at the top, 0% at bottom.

This gradient covers the entire width of the three cards collectively (not each card separately).

Center Text Section (Title & Subtitle)

Position this text centrally above the cards (not inside any card).

Use absolute positioning or a centered overlay container at the top of the three-card section.

Title:

Text: “Our Focus”

Font weight: 700 (bold)

Font size: 48px

Color: #FFFFFF

Alignment: center

Shadow: optional subtle text-shadow for better readability (e.g., 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3))

Subtitle:

Text: “Sustainable Tourism, Culture, and Entertainmenta”

Font weight: 400 (regular)

Font size: 20–22px

Color: #FFFFFF

Letter spacing: 0.5px

Text alignment: center

Max width: wide enough to stretch across all three cards (around 70–80% of container width)

Positioned just below the title (10–15px spacing)

Card Details

Each of the 3 cards should have:

Equal width (33.33% each)

Full height (match section height, e.g., 400–500px)

Background images:

Tourism → mountain / desert explorer scene

Culture → traditional architecture or fortress

Entertainment → musicians or performers

Overlay gradient on each image (optional slight dark gradient from bottom for contrast).

Bottom Text (inside each card)

Texts: “Tourism”, “Culture”, “Entertainment”

Font size: 24–26px

Font weight: 700

Color: #FFFFFF

Position: bottom-left corner, 30px from left, 20–30px from bottom.

Apply a subtle text shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.5) for visibility.

Spacing & Borders

Add 2px white vertical borders between the three cards.

No horizontal borders.

Cards should have slight rounded corners (8px) if the layout allows.

Maintain consistent height alignment for all cards.
