Goal: Recreate a clean, modern “Events & Activities Calendar” section with perfect vertical alignment between the calendar sidebar (left) and event cards list (right). The top of both columns and the bottom of the last elements must be aligned.

Layout Structure

Use a 2-column grid layout centered on the page:

Left column (Calendar panel): 30–35% width

Right column (Event cards list): 65–70% width

Keep consistent top padding (e.g. 60px) and bottom margin (e.g. 60px) so both columns visually start and end on the same line.

Add a subtle shadow and rounded corners (radius 16px) for both the calendar and event cards.

Left Column – Calendar Panel

Card background: #FFFFFF

Shadow: soft, rgba(0,0,0,0.05), blur 12px

Padding: 24px

Include:

Title: “Event Calendar” – font-weight: 600, size: 16px, color: #1F2937

Calendar component: minimalist square grid, highlighted selected date with accent color (#FBBF24)

Selected date info box: small rounded card, light yellow background (#FFF8E6), subtle border

Stats row: 2 small info cards side by side (e.g., “Total Events”, “Cities”), both 50% width, border radius 12px

Right Column – Event Cards List

Each card:

Width: 100%

Responsive Behavior

On mobile: stack vertically, calendar on top, events list below.

On desktop: maintain perfect column alignment and equal visual spacing top and bottom.

Prompt Summary

“Design an Events & Activities Calendar section with two perfectly aligned columns — a left calendar panel and right event list. Use a clean modern layout with soft shadows, rounded corners, and matching top and bottom spacing between both sections. The typography should be elegant and readable (Inter/Poppins), with yellow and orange accent colors for highlights and pricing.”
