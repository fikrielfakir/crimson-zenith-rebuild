Goal:
Redesign the “Events & Activities Calendar” section with a fresh, modern, and professional look, keeping the same horizontal and vertical spacing (same left/right/top/bottom limits) as the current layout.

🧭 Layout & Structure

Keep a two-column layout:

Left side: Event Calendar widget

Right side: Upcoming events list

Maintain the same container width and padding as the original page to preserve alignment with the navbar and overall site structure.

Add a consistent vertical rhythm (spacing between calendar, event cards, and section titles).

🪶 Design Style

Use a clean modern aesthetic with soft shadows, rounded corners (12–16px), and minimal borders.

Incorporate subtle gradient accents in the buttons and section titles (e.g., gold-to-beige gradient for highlights).

Replace the plain white background with a very light off-white or slightly tinted gradient background (#FAFAFB or #F9F9F9).

Use a frosted glass or blurred panel effect behind the event cards for a premium feel.

Add small event category tag (e.g., “Featured”, “Festival”) in a corner with color-coded pill badges.

📊 Footer Section (Bottom of Calendar)

Keep the total events and cities counters but redesign them as mini cards:

Each with icon, label, and value centered.

Use soft gradient backgrounds and gentle inner shadows for depth.

💡 Interactions & Animations

Smooth fade-in on scroll for each event card.

Slight hover lift animation on buttons and cards.

Use micro-interactions when selecting a date in the calendar (e.g., pop highlight pulse).
